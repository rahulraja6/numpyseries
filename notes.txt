Numpy notes

Day 1:
NumPy, short for Numerical Python
Contains Scientific Computational Packages
--> ndarray multidimensional array of homogeneous datatype
--> Unlike list numpy has fixed size on creation. Changing the size will create a new ndarray and delete the old one.
-->The elements in a NumPy array will be the same size in memory(homogeneous). The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.
-->Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops.
